More than ever, we need a resilient Left. This means we need a strong Left media, capable of thinking honestly about the issues facing us, tackling these issues head-on, as well as reaching out to those who aren‚Äôt yet on side. Our wide range of output ‚Äì from listicles to essays, from punchy videos to in-depth discussions ‚Äì does exactly that.\n\nBut all this costs money: studio rent, equipment, contributor fees and digital infrastructure. We do a lot with a little, but we can‚Äôt do anything with nothing. We won‚Äôt charge for content or cash in on sponsorship deals with Pepsi. We don‚Äôt have private fortunes, or state backers, or big capital behind us ‚Äì we just have you.\n\nNot everyone can afford to give ‚Äì but if you enjoy our work, and you believe in what we‚Äôre doing, maybe you could forego a couple of your preferred beverages this month and lend us a hand instead. In the longer term, growing our regular subscriber base will allow us to meet the future well-prepared ‚Äì so if you can spare a few quid a month, why not sign up for a regular subscription?\n\nWe‚Äôve achieved so much already ‚Äì but the truth is, we‚Äôve barely begun. Be a part of the change. Help us build a new media for a different politics."

What started out as a week experiment to film his life everyday for 7 days in a row has now become SACCONEJOLYS\n\nthis channel was formally known as LeFloofTV but was later changed to SACCONEJOLYs\n\nWhen Jonathan Joly married Anna Saccone they both decided that instead of Anna dropping her family name they would both take each others name and join them together.\n\nThey choose to use SACCONEJOLY rather then JOLYSACCONE simply because it sounded better.\n\nJonathan and Anna Saccone Joly have three children, Emilia Saccone Joly, Eduardo Saccone Joly and Alessia Saccone Joly. they also have six maltese dogs, Albi, Sina, Theo, Bianca, Nivea and Nuvola.\n\nThey moved from Ireland to the UK in 2014.\n\n********************************"

Some in Silicon Valley are even calling for a basic minimum income provided by the government for everyone, under the assumption that work will become scarce. But many economists are skeptical of these claims, because the notion that the the economy offers a fixed amount of work has been debunked time and time again over the centuries and current economic data show no signs of a productivity boom. Fortunately, we don't need to divine the future of the labor market in order to prepare for it. \n\n///\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Appearing on ABC‚Äôs This Week today, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway was asked about the disturbing allegations that Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore initiated sexual contact with a 14-year-old when he was 32.\nSpeaking to guest host Martha Raddatz, Conway noted that the ‚Äúconduct described‚Äù in the allegations‚Äù should disqualify anyone from serving in public office.‚Äù She further pointed out that Trump has said that Moore should step aside ‚Äúif the allegations are true.‚Äù\nConway went on to state that the president isn‚Äôt overly concerned with this story at the moment as his attention is focused on his Asia visit.\n‚ÄúI will say that the president is not as focused on this as he is his major 13-day trip abroad,‚Äù Conway said. ‚ÄúSo he made a statement, he‚Äôs sticking by that statement.‚Äù\nShe continued, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not being briefed on this bit by bit. He‚Äôs very focused on trade agreements.

At the same time, Conway said that we shouldn‚Äôt always be prosecuting people through the press."

Impressed with your show and making something of your own. My question is in the wake of Hurricane Kevin Spacey do you think filmmakers / producers / directors will now use private investigators to look into their potential cast before they hire them to ensure there‚Äôs nothing that will embarrass/torpedo their project?\n\nGood Job Inc - Hey John, I think you're a genius speaking wise! As an aspiring director, my question is this: Why doesn't the director also get the Best Picture Oscar when the film wins said Oscar? I know producers have a lot to do with making the movie but we all agree that the movie is the directors VISION. Do you think that the director should get awarded as well?\n\nJessica McNeil - Hi John! The BF and I watch the show everyday when we get home from work. Thanks for all you do! With Justice League reactions now out there, how should we feel? I‚Äôve been excited for the movie but don‚Äôt know how to take the limited reactions I‚Äôve been seeing.

If that‚Äôs the case, why doesn‚Äôt Disney just forget about Fox and just buy Netflix?\n\nAlfred Agcaoili - Aloha John. Big fan of your show.
